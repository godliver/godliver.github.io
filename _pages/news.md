### I'm a program chair for <a href="https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa-2026">Data Science Africa, 2026</a> at Makerere University. July 20th - 24th, 2026 <br>
Together with  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeleke-o-bankole-ph-d-a666277a/">Dr. Adeleke Bankole</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurelle-tchagna-phd-eng-453362111/">Dr. Aurelle TCHAGNA </a>
 

## Research Projects
### Climate and Agriculture:
I lead research in early disease monitoring through advanced and low-cost technologies. About 40% of the global crop production is lost to pests. Sub-Saharan Africa is most vulnerable to the increasing risks of pests and diseases spreading in agriculture. We are building low-cost sensory tools to detect diseases before they manifested on the leaves. Thanks to our partnership with ICAIN, DSA and other partners for supporting our work.

### Eductaion and Capacity Buiding
### AI for All
I lead initiatives focused on closing the AI knowledge gap in our community - "AI for All". I work to engage a wide range of stakeholders across the education spectrum, communities and policymakers. Thanks to our partnership with ICAIN, DSA and other partners for supporting this initiative. 

### Erasmus+ 171 student and staff exchange program
Together with  <a href="https://estefaniatalavera.github.io/">Dr. Estefanía Talavera</a>, we got Erasmus+ 171 funding to foster collaboration between the University of Twente and the Universities of Busitema (Tororo) and Makerere (Kampala), Uganda.
More than 10 students (PhDs and Masters) have benefited from this exchange program since 2022. 

### Awards and Recorgnitions
I have received several awards and recognitions, and my PhD thesis award is a reminder of why the work I do every day matters :) <br>
