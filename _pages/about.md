I'm a Senior Lecturer and researcher at <a href="https://busitema.ac.ug/">Busitma University</a> in the Faculty of Engineering. I'm also part of the Makerere AI Research Group. I earned my PhD in Computational Intelligence and Modeling of Crop Disease Data in Africa from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, under the supervision of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.cs.rug.nl/~biehl/" target="_blank"> Prof. Michael Biehl </a>, <a href="https://emwebaze.github.io/" target="_blank"> Dr. Ernest Mwebaze</a>, and <a href="https://jquinn.air.ug/"> Dr. John A. Quinn </a>.  My most impactful PhD work involved using spectrometry to detect cassava plant diseases before they became symptomatic on the leaves. This research was particularly notable for developing new algorithms and low-cost tools aimed at deploying these algorithms to address societal problems. Consequently, my thesis was awarded the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/01/best-engineering-thesis-2021-for">  Best Engineering Thesis of 2020 by the University of Groningen. <br>

My Bachelors and Masters degree are in Computer Science from Makerere University received in 2011 and 2015 respectively. My research interests concern theoretical and practical aspects of artificial intelligence, in particular, computer vision and machine learning techniques in relation to solving real world problems.
